# tls13-sm-spec
The repository hosts the IETF Internet-Draft (I-D) of Chinese cipher suites in TLSv1.3 and related documentation.

The I-D specifies a method of applying SM cipher suites within Transport Layer Security protocol version 1.3.

It's appreciated to have more organizations as well as individuals to co-operate on this I-D.

# The Draft

# Chinese Algorithm Standards

This is a little complicated so I decide to explain a bit first.

There are several standard organizations have already published or are publishing SM related specifications:

* CSTC (Cryptography Standardization Technical Committee), publishes the `GM/T` prefixed standards, which are the original SM algorithm specifications.
* NISSTC (National Information Security Standardization Technical Committee), is in charge of turning `GM/T` files into `GB/T` files. So they are identical to each other from the aspect of content, except the names of the published standards are different. NISSTC is more normative than CSTC from a legal point of view.
* ISO (International Organization for Standardization), has published SM2, SM3 and SM9 in different ISO files. SM4 is now on its process to be included in.

The following table can be used to sort out the relations between different specification files.

*Note: as mentioned, GM/Ts' and GB/Ts' contents are identical to each other except minor naming difference*

We almost have all necessary English specifications here in the table. The current missing one is GM/T 0009-2012 (a.k.a., GB/T 35276-2017), we are now figuring out this missing and will update the table above if there is any update.
