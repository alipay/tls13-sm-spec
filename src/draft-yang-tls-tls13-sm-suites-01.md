--- abstract

This draft specifies a set of cipher suites for the Transport
Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.3 to support SM cryptographic
algorithms.

--- middle

Introduction        {#intro}
============

This document describes two new cipher suites for the Transport Layer Security
(TLS) protocol version 1.3 (a.k.a TLSv1.3, {{RFC8446}}). The new cipher suites
are listed as follows (or {{proposed}}):

~~~~~~~
   CipherSuite TLS_SM4_GCM_SM3 = { 0x00, 0xC6 };
   CipherSuite TLS_SM4_CCM_SM3 = { 0x00, 0xC7 };
~~~~~~~

These new cipher suites contains several SM cryptographic algorithms that
provide both authentication and confidentiality. For the more detailed
introduction to SM cryptographic algorithms, please read {{sm-algos}}.
These cipher suites follow what TLSv1.3 requires. For instance, all the cipher
suites mentioned in this draft use ECDHE as the key exchange scheme and use
SM4 in either GCM mode or CCM mode to meet the need of TLSv1.3 to have an AEAD
capable encryption algorithm.

For the details about how these new cipher suites negotiate shared encryption
key and protect the record structure, please read {{definitions}}.


The SM Algorithms    {#sm-algos}
-------------------

The new cipher suites defined in this draft use several different SM
cryptographic algorithms including SM2 for authentication, SM4 for
encryption and SM3 as the hash function.

SM2 is a set of elliptic curve based cryptographic algorithms including digital
signature, public key encryption and key exchange scheme. In this draft, only
the SM2 digital signature algorithm is involved, which has now already been added
to ISO/IEC 14888-3:2018 {{ISO-SM2}} (as well as in {{GBT.32918.2-2016}}).
SM4 is a block cipher defined in {{GBT.32907-2016}} and now is being standardized
by ISO to ISO/IEC 18033-3:2010 {{ISO-SM4}}. SM3 is a hash function which produces
an output of 256 bits. SM3 has already been accepted by ISO in
ISO/IEC 10118-3:2018 {{ISO-SM3}}, and also been described by {{GBT.32905-2016}}.


Terminology     {#term}
-----------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, BCP 14
{{RFC2119}} and indicate requirement levels for compliant TLSv1.3
implementations.


Proposed Cipher Suites     {#proposed}
=====================

The cipher suites defined here have the following identifiers:

~~~~~~~~
   CipherSuite TLS_SM4_GCM_SM3 = { 0x00, 0xC6 };
   CipherSuite TLS_SM4_CCM_SM3 = { 0x00, 0xC7 };
~~~~~~~~

To accomplish a TLSv1.3 handshake, more objects have been introduced along with
the cipher suites as follows.

The SM2 signature algorithm and SM3 hash function used in the Signature Algorithm
extension defined in appendix-B.3.1.3 of {{RFC8446}}:

~~~~~~~~
   SignatureScheme sm2sig_sm3 = { 0x0708 };
~~~~~~~~

The SM2 elliptic curve ID used in the Supported Groups extension defined in
appendix-B.3.1.4 of {{RFC8446}}:

~~~~~~~~
   NamedGroup curveSM2 = { 41 };
~~~~~~~~


Cipher Suites Definitions  {#definitions}
=========================

TLS Versions
------------

The only capable version for the new cipher suites defined in this document
is TLSv1.3. Implementations of this document MUST NOT apply these cipher suites
into any TLS protocols that have an older version than 1.3.

Authentication
--------------

### SM2 Signature Scheme

All cipher suites defined in this document use SM2 signature algorithm as the
authentication method when doing a TLSv1.3 handshake.

SM2 signature is defined in {{ISO-SM2}}. In general, SM2 is a signature algorithm
based on elliptic curves. SM2 signature algorithm uses a fixed elliptic curve
parameter set defined in {{GBT.32918.5-2016}}. This curve has the name curveSM2
and IANA is requested to assign a value for it. Unlike other elliptic curve
based public key algorithm like ECDSA, SM2 cannot select other elliptic curves
in practice, but it's allowed to write test cases by using other elliptic curve
parameter sets for SM2, take Annex F.14 of {{ISO-SM2}} as a reference.

Implementations of the cipher suites defined in this document SHOULD conform to
what {{GBT.32918.5-2016}} requires, that is to say, the only valid elliptic curve
parameter for SM2 signature algorithm (a.k.a curveSM2) is defined as follows:

~~~~~~~~
   curveSM2: a prime field of 256 bits

   y^2 = x^3 + ax + b

   p  = FFFFFFFE FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF
        FFFFFFFF 00000000 FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF
   a  = FFFFFFFE FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF
        FFFFFFFF 00000000 FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFC
   b  = 28E9FA9E 9D9F5E34 4D5A9E4B CF6509A7
        F39789F5 15AB8F92 DDBCBD41 4D940E93
   n  = FFFFFFFE FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF
        7203DF6B 21C6052B 53BBF409 39D54123
   Gx = 32C4AE2C 1F198119 5F990446 6A39C994
        8FE30BBF F2660BE1 715A4589 334C74C7
   Gy = BC3736A2 F4F6779C 59BDCEE3 6B692153
        D0A9877C C62A4740 02DF32E5 2139F0A0
~~~~~~~~

SM2 signature algorithm requests an identifier value when generate the signature,
as well as when verifying an SM2 signature. Implementations of this document
MUST use the following ASCII string value as the SM2 identifier when doing a
TLSv1.3 key exchange:

~~~~~~~~
   TLSv1.3+GM+Cipher+Suite
~~~~~~~~

Except if either a client or a server needs to verify the peer's SM2 certificate
contained in the Certificate message, the following ASCII string value SHOULD be
used as the SM2 identifier according to {{GMT.0009-2012}}:

~~~~~~~~
   1234567812345678
~~~~~~~~

In the octet presentation, it should be:

~~~~~~~~
   0x31, 0x32, 0x33, 0x34, 0x35, 0x36, 0x37, 0x38,
   0x31, 0x32, 0x33, 0x34, 0x35, 0x36, 0x37, 0x38
~~~~~~~~

In practice, the SM2 identifier used in a certificate signature depends on the
CA who signs that certificate. CAs may choose other values rather than the one
mentioned above. Implementations of this document SHOULD confirm this information
by themselves.

Key Exchange  {#kx}
------------

### Hello Messages

The new cipher suites defined in this document update the key exchange
information in the Hello messages. Implementations of these new ciphers suites
MUST conform to the new requirements.

#### ClientHello

A TLSv1.3 client is REQUIRED to include the new cipher suites in its 'cipher_suites'
array of the ClientHello structure defined in Section 4.1.2 of {{RFC8446}}.

Other requirements on the extensions of ClientHello message are:

* For supported_groups extension, 'curveSM2' MUST be included;
* For signature_algorithms extension, 'sm2sig_sm3' MUST be included;
* For signature_algorithms_cert extension (if presented), 'sm2sig_sm3' MUST be included;
* For key_share extension, a KeyShareEntry with SM2 related values MUST be added
if the client wants to start a TLSv1.3 key negotiation using SM cipher suites.

#### ServerHello

If a TLSv1.3 server receives a ClientHello message containing the new cipher
suites defined in this document, it MAY choose to use the new cipher suites. If
so, then the server MUST put one of the new cipher suites defined in this
document into its ServerHello's 'cipher_suites' array and eventually sends it
to the client side.

The following extensions MUST conform to the new requirements:

* For key_share extension, a KeyShareEntry with SM2 related values MUST be added
if the server wants to start a TLSv1.3 key negotiation using SM cipher suites.

### CertificateRequest

If a CertificateRequest message is sent by the server to require the client
to send its certificate for authentication purpose, the following requirements
MUST be fulfilled:

* The only valid signature algorithm present in 'signature_algorithms' extension
MUST be 'sm2sig_sm3'. That is to say, if server finally chooses to use a SM
cipher suite, the signature algorithm for client's certificate SHOULD only be
SM2 and SM3 capable ones.

### Certificate

When server sends the Certificate message which contains the server certificate
to the client side, several new rules are added that will affect the certificate
selection:

* The public key in the certificate MUST be a valid SM2 public key.
* The signature algorithm used by the CA to sign current certificate MUST be
sm2sig_sm3.
* The certificate MUST be capable for signing, e.g., the digitalSignature bit
of X.509's Key Usage extension is set.

### CertificateVerify

In the certificateVerify message, the signature algorithm MUST be sm2sig_sm3,
indicating the hash function MUST be SM3 and the signature algorithm MUST be
SM2 signature algorithm.

Key Scheduling
-------------

As described in {{sm-algos}}, SM2 is actually a set of cryptographic
algorithms including one key exchange protocol which defines methods such as
key derivation function, etc. In this document, SM2 key exchange protocol is
not introduced and SHALL NOT be used in the key exchange steps defined in
{{kx}}. Implementations of this document SHOULD always conform to what TLSv1.3
{{RFC8446}} and its successors require about the key derivation and related
methods.

Cipher
------

The new cipher suites introduced in this document add two new AEAD encryption
algorithms, AEAD_SM4_GCM and AEAD_SM4_CCM, which stand for SM4 cipher in Galois/Counter
mode and SM4 cipher [GBT.32907-2016] in Counter with CBC-MAC mode, respectively.

This section defines the AEAD_SM4_GCM and AEAD_SM4_CCM AEAD algorithms in a
style of what {{RFC5116}} has used to define AEAD ciphers based on AES cipher.

### AEAD_SM4_GCM

The AEAD_SM4_GCM authenticated encryption algorithm works as specified in [GCM],
using SM4 as the block cipher, by providing the key, nonce, and plaintext, and
associated data to that mode of operation. An authentication tag conformed to
what Section 5.2 of TLSv1.3 {{RFC8446}} requires is used, which in details SHOULD
be constructed by the TLS record header. The AEAD_SM4_GCM ciphertext is formed by
appending the authentication tag provided as an output to the GCM encryption
operation to the ciphertext that is output by that operation. AEAD_SM4_GCM has 
four inputs: an SM4 key, an initialization vector (IV), a plaintext content, and optional 
additional authenticated data (AAD). AEAD_SM4_GCM generates two outputs: a ciphertext 
and message authentication code (also called an authentication tag). To have a common 
set of terms for AEAD_SM4_GCM and AEAD_SM4_CCM, the AEAD_SM4_GCM IV is referred to as a 
nonce in the remainder of this document. A simple test vector of AEAD_SM4_GCM and 
AEAD_SM4_CCM is given in Appendix A of this document.

The nonce is generated by the party performing the authenticated encryption operation.  
Within the scope of any authenticated-encryption key, the nonce value MUST be unique.  
That is, the set of nonce values used with any given key MUST NOT contain any duplicate 
values.  Using the same nonce for two different messages encrypted with the same key 
destroys the security properties.To generate the nonce, implementations of this document 
MUST conform to what TLSv1.3 specifies (See {{RFC8446}}, Section 5.3).

AAD is authenticated but not encrypted. Thus, the AAD is not included in the SM4-CCM 
output.  It can be used to authenticate plaintext packet headers.  

The input and output lengths are as follows:

~~~~~~~~
   SM4 key length is 16 octets,

   Max plaintext length is 2^36 - 31 octets,

   Max AAD length is 2^61 - 1 octets,

   Nonce length is 12 octets, 
   
   Authentication tag length is 16 octets, and

   Max Ciphertext length is 2^36 - 15 octets.
~~~~~~~~

A security analysis of GCM is available in [MV04].

### AEAD_SM4_CCM

The AEAD_SM4_CCM authenticated encryption algorithm works as specified in [CCM],
using SM4 as the block cipher, AEAD_SM4_CCM has four inputs: an SM4 key, a nonce, 
a plaintext, and optional additional authenticated data (AAD). AEAD_SM4_CCM 
generates two outputs: a ciphertext and a message authentication code (also called 
an authentication tag). The formatting and counter generation function are as 
specified in Appendix A of that reference, and the values of the parameters 
identified in that appendix are as follows:

~~~~~~~~
   the nonce length n is 12,

   the tag length t is 16, and

   the value of q is 3.
~~~~~~~~

An authentication tag conformed to what Section 5.2 of TLSv1.3 {{RFC8446}}
requires is used, which in details SHOULD be constructed by the TLS record header.
The AEAD_SM4_CCM ciphertext is formed by appending the authentication tag provided
as an output to the CCM encryption operation to the ciphertext that is output
by that operation. The input and output lengths are as follows:

~~~~~~~~
   SM4 key length is is 16 octets,

   Max plaintext length is 2^24 - 1 octets,

   Max AAD length is 2^64 - 1 octets, and

   Max Ciphertext length is 2^24 + 15 octets.
~~~~~~~~

To generate the nonce, implementations of this document MUST conform to what
TLSv1.3 specifies (See {{RFC8446}}, Section 5.3).

A security analysis of CCM is available in [J02].

Hash
----

SM3 is defined by ISO as {{ISO-SM3}}. During a TLSv1.3 handshake with SM cipher
suites, the hash function is REQUIRED to be SM3. Implementations MUST use SM3
for digest, key derivation, Transcript-Hash and other purposes during a TLSv1.3
key exchange process.


IANA Considerations
===================

IANA has assigned the values {0x00, 0xC6} and {0x00, 0xC7} with the names
TLS_SM4_GCM_SM3, TLS_SM4_CCM_SM3,
to the "TLS Cipher Suite" registry with this document as reference,
as shown below.

|   Value    | Description | DTLS-OK | Recommended | Reference |
|-----------:+-----------------+-----+-------------+-----------|
| 0x00,0xC6  | TLS_SM4_GCM_SM3 | No  |      No     | this RFC  |
| 0x00,0xC7  | TLS_SM4_CCM_SM3 | No  |      No     | this RFC  |

IANA has assigned the value 0x0708 with the name sm2sig_sm3, to the
"TLS SignatureScheme" registry, as shown below.

|  Value | Description | DTLS-OK | Recommended | Reference |
|-------:+-------------+---------+-------------+-----------|
| 0x0708 | sm2sig_sm3  |    No   |     No      | this RFC  |

IANA has assigned the value 41 with the name curveSM2, to the
"TLS Supported Groups" registry, as shown below.

| Value | Description | DTLS-OK | Recommended | Reference |
|------:+-------------+---------+-------------+-----------|
|  41   |  curveSM2   |   No    |     No      | this RFC  |


Security Considerations
=======================

At the time of writing this draft, there are no known weak keys for SM
cryptographic algorithms SM2, SM3 and SM4, and no security problem
has been found on those algorithms.

* The cipher suites described in this document *MUST NOT* be used with TLSv1.2
  or earlier.
